# 🎨 Accent Color Icon Theme Changer For GNOME 🌈

Welcome to the **Accent Directories**! 🎉 This GNOME Shell extension is here to add a splash of color to your icon themes! 🌟

## What Does It Do? 🤔

Ever wanted your adwaita icons to match your mood? 😄 Well, now they can! This extension automatically changes your icon theme based on the accent color you choose in your GNOME settings. So, if you switch to a **purple** accent, your icons will transform into the fabulous **MoreWaita-Purple** theme! 💜✨

## Features 🚀

- **Automatic Icon Theme Switching**: Your icons will change as you change your accent color! 🎨
- **Icon Theme Installation**: If you don't have the necessary icon themes, this extension will copy them from its assets folder to your local icons directory! 🛠️

## Acknowledgments 🙏

A big shoutout to the [GNOME](https://gnome.org) and [MoreWaita](https://github.com/somepaulo/MoreWaita) community for their amazing work! 💖

Now go ahead and color your world! 🌍✨
